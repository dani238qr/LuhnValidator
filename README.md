# LuhnValidator

LuhnValidator is a C program designed to validate numeric identifiers such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, and other identification codes that utilize the Luhn algorithm.

This algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers to ensure they are correctly formatted and to prevent errors during data entry.

The algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is specified in ISO/IEC 7812-1. 
It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks.
Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers.
